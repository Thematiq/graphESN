Following repository contains code used for model benchmarking performed for master thesis. 

- directory `time_series/` contains Temp-gESN model with training and evaluation based on [multivaratie time series data repository](https://github.com/laiguokun/multivariate-time-series-data);
- directory `graph_classification/src/graph_esn` contains GESN model;
- directory `graph_classification/src/fair_evaluation` contains scikit learn implementation of fair evaluation regime from [A Fair Comparison of Graph Neural Networks for Graph Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09893);
- directory `graph_classification/hyperparams` contains hyperparameters used for each of the models for fair evaluation benchmark.
